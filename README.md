# Dotfiles

Hey! After a lot of rambling, I'll be posting dotfiles of my dear **Arch Linux** setup, my main tasks using this environment are **programming** and **cybersecurity** work, so you'll probably see some weird configs that will be geared towards that.

I ask that those who want to use most of the settings, to **fork this repository** so that I can see your additional settings and maybe add them to my setup too, I'm always implementing it, in advance, **thanks!**

_WIP: I will be working on a script to install my dotfiles automatically, after a clean install of Arch Linux._
